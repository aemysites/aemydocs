# Experience Catalyst

Transform your website to Adobe Experience Manager Edge Delivery Services with AI-powered automation.

## What is Experience Catalyst?

Experience Catalyst is Adobe's AI-powered migration tool that transforms existing websites into high-performance Edge Delivery Services sites. Instead of months of manual migration work, Experience Catalyst uses intelligent automation to complete the process in hours or days while maintaining your site's design and functionality.

### Why It Matters

- **Faster Time to Market**: Launch your modernized site in days, not months
- **Reduced Migration Costs**: Automated conversion eliminates 80% of manual effort
- **Performance Excellence**: Achieve perfect Lighthouse scores and Core Web Vitals
- **Future-Ready Architecture**: Built for the AI era with Edge Delivery Services

### Code Less, Ship More

Experience Catalyst fundamentally changes how developers approach website migration. Instead of manually recreating templates, writing parsers, and mapping content, you leverage AEMY's (Github Integrated AI Agent for Experience Catalyst) capabilities to handle the repetitive work while maintaining full control over the output.

- **GitHub-Native Workflow**: Work with AEMY through issues and PRs
- **Full Control**: Review and modify all generated code
- **Modern Stack**: Edge Delivery Services, Git-based content, component architecture
