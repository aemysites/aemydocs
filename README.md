# Site Migration Skill

The Site Migration skill within the Experience Production Agent (EPA) is an AI-powered web development assistant that can migrate, create, and evolve Edge Delivery Services (EDS) sites end to end — from initial idea to a production-ready implementation — without requiring you to write a single line of code or install anything on your machine.

You can think of this skill as an “idea to EDS website” engine, available through a hosted UI. You describe what you want in a prompt, the agent plans and executes the changes, and you review and refine the result. All code changes go through standard Git/PR workflows, so developers retain full control over what ships to production, and content changes can be pushed easily to AEM Document Authoring.

Examples of possible prompts include (but are not limited to):

- “Migrate the page https://wknd-trendsetters.site into EDS.”
- “Import the content from this page into EDS.”
- “Import the general design from this reference site.”
- “Adjust the general button style as follows: …”
- “Create a campaign landing page based on the following brief: …”

The Site Migration skill is currently available in an FDE-operated model, delivered as a service operated by Adobe engineers to ensure migration success. As early preview, customers in FDE-led projects can also use the hosted UI themselves to prompt smaller follow-up tasks.
